# Introduction

This site holds documentation for the [create-rust-app](https://github.com/Wulf/create-rust-app) project.
It is heavily inspired but not related to create-react-app.

### Work in Progress

Open up terminal, Install tsync with 'cargo install tsync'

Install Diesel with 'cargo install diesel_cli'  (make sure you have sql, postgres, and or sqlite installed)

Then install Create Rust App Template with  'cargo install create-rust-app_cli'


Expect documentation on this site in the future. For now, please create issues in the github repository for any questions or discussions.
